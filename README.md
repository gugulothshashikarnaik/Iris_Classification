# Iris_Classification
This project analyzes the Iris dataset to classify iris species based on their physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). It implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict species and provides insights into classification performance through visualizations and reports.
