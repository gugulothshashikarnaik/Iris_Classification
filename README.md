# Project Name: Iris Classification

## Description
This project analyzes the Iris dataset to classify iris species based on their physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). It implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict species and provides insights into classification performance through visualizations and reports.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset.
- Visualization of species distribution and feature relationships.
- Implementation of the KNN classification algorithm.
- Detailed classification reporting with accuracy metrics.
- Confusion matrix visualization for model evaluation.

## Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gugulothshashikarnaik/Iris_Classification.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd iris-classification
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Load the dataset: Ensure that the `iris.csv` file is located in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Run the classification script:
    ```bash
    python iris_classification.py
    ```

2. The script will output the classification accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
